A curious student, researcher, and activist from Bangladesh, currently based in Singapore. I am particularly interested in the intersection of marine ecology and molecular ecology. I have been working on various molecular and computational approaches to marine conservation, particularly involving corals, seagrasses, Christmas tree worms, and sharks. Environmental advocacy is another interest of mine, particularly how to encourage action and engagement among people. I am always keen to work on and translate projects to be applied and solutions-focused, especially with translating academic knowledge into community and policy-level media. I believe conservation research is limited unless we learn to make it accessible and to take in from both conventional scientific and traditional forms of knowledge. When I am not involved with my work, I enjoy cycling, hiking, diving, dancing tango, or playing board games with friends!

Feel free to reach out to me if you're interested in having a (casual) chat about any of my experiences or topics I have mentioned!
